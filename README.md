# BlingBling theme for enlightenment

BlingBling Enlightenment theme is the old default theme for Enlightenment:

It is intended to be conservative and still show off some aspects of Enlightenment such as the ability to animate transitions and do different layouts for objects. 

The original theme was created by Rasterman. Further work on it was done by 'verdegal37' and published [here](http://e17-stuff.org/content/show.php?content=108719).

With considerable help from Duma I have started porting the theme to e20 (hence also for e19).

The Elementary code is from a derivation of this theme, "R-Volcano R-E19" by 'rpil' from [here](http://e17-stuff.org/content/show.php/R-Volcano+R-E19?content=167690). It has been modified only to the point that the most e20 dialogs look good enough, expect some inconsistencies in e apps.

Full credit goes to the artists, in particular 'rpil' and 'Duma'. My role is limited to technical adaptation and minor fixes, since I really want to use this theme.

As the original, this theme is licensed under the [GPL](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html).

Please note that this is work in progress and not yet complete.
